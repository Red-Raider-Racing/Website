            <h3 class="faq">What is Formula SAE?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The SAE International Formula program is an engineering design competition for undergraduate and graduate students. The competition provides participants with the opportunity to enhance their engineering design and project management skills by applying learned classroom theories in a challenging competition. The engineering design goal for teams is to develop and construct a singe-seat race car for the non-profession weekend autocross racer with the best overall package of design, construction, performance, and cost.  learn more about FSAE, visit the <a href="https://www.fsaeonline.com/page.aspx?pageid=c4c5195a-60c0-46aa-acbf-2958ef545b72" target="_blank">SAE International website</a>.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>After the difficult COVID-19 pandemic, the team came back to the 2022 Formula SAE competition and received beneficial feedback on some of our design decisions, business and team structure to apply to future year. This season we will strive to apply as many pointers that the judges gave us for a more performant car and better ranking at the Competition. We will continually work with sponsors this year to receive the most support possible. We have many projects in sight for this year, so if you are interested in joining the team and want to help us improve, please join on Tech Connect or reach out to us.</p>
