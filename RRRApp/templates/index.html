        <p>
            Red Raider Racing is a student-led organization that gives Texas Tech 
            University students the opportunity to get hands-on experience by 
            designing, fabricating, and marketing a Formula SAE car. Each year, 
            our team designs and manufactures a brand-new FSAE vehicle to compete 
            in the International Collegiate Design Competition. Our student 
            organization is composed of 14 officers as well as over 100+ members 
            that work together to develop a technically sound and competitive car.
