# Red Raider Racing Official Website

In August 2023, I offered to create a new website for Red Raider Racing. I met with the organization to determine what was wanted and so I could create some personal goals for myself. Before this project I had a little knowledge of Django and web development. I was confident in myself to learn these subjects in depth. I can say that I am much more proficient in Django. Please feel free to visit [Red Raider Racing's Official Website](http://www.redraiderracing.com).

## Goals

- **Gain Experience:** The main goal was to make this a learning opportunity for myself. Take advantage of the opportunity. Now that the project is over I can confidently say that I have learned so much during my time working on it.
- **Save Money:** I wanted to make sure to save the club money. I ended up reducing website costs by roughly 61%.
- **Fresh Start:** We wanted to be sure that the website is industry standard. Throughout my time working on this project I was constantly documenting within the code as well as on an OneNote document for users who wouldn't be going into the code.
- **Editability:** I understand that I won't be with the organization forever. I wanted to add the ability to edit later down the road. Because the club is mostly consisted of Mechanical Engineering majors (people who aren't taught how to code), I made it so administrators can edit the site without even going into the code at all.

## Side Notes

- **Efficiency:** Though it wasn't a goal, I was able to speed up the website by nearly 96%. With this users can browse the website easily without being slowed down by response times.
- **Mobile:** When creating the website, I really wanted to focus on mobile users. I learned that mobile users make up over 55% of all users on the internet. I was able to successful add sizing of the website on all mobile devices.
